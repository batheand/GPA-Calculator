This project is about a simple program to calculate your GPA either by number grades or letter grades. It uses a terminal UI and therefore it's simple
 and efficient.

This project is currently partially-finalized. The partners of the project, Batuhan Yıldız and Can Mızraklı, agreed on a work distribution where Batuhan
will handle the calculate by number part and Can will handle the calculate by letter part.

Batuhan Yıldız has succesfully finalized his part and Can Mızraklı is currently working on his part.
